in Inventory Management there is some mistake so make it correct

---

I need to examine the inventory management code to identify and fix the issues. Let me first look at the inventory-related files to understand the current implementation.

---

Let me examine the inventory backend files to identify the issues:

---

Now let me check the frontend inventory files to identify issues:

---

Let me also check the frontend inventory pages to see the complete picture:

---

Now let me check the database schema to understand the Item model:

---

Now let me check if there are any issues with the inventory routes registration:

---

Now I can see the issues in the Inventory Management system. Let me analyze and fix them:

## Issues Found:

1. **Duplicate route registration**: Both `/api/inventory` and `/api/items` are pointing to the same routes
2. **Missing `getItem` endpoint**: The API has `getItem` method but no corresponding route
3. **Inconsistent error handling**: Some places use different error handling patterns
4. **Missing validation**: No proper input validation in the service layer
5. **Dashboard stats query issue**: Using `item` instead of `Item` model in dashboard

Let me fix these issues:

---

Adding the missing getItem route and importing the controller

---

Adding the missing getItemController and importing getItem service

---

Adding proper validation, getItem service, and better error handling
